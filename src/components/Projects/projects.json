      "description": "My project 2 was a group collaboration to create a musical vision board for a user to organize records using node, express, and MySQL. Reel2real uses the Discogs API to get record data, and node and express to manipulate it. Users can sign up, login/out, search a records database by artist and fill out crates of records they want or have. Future development goals would be a functional shop, better user search and customization, and integrating the Reverb API to make Reel2real a one stop shop for music lovers.",

The user should see the current date, and a calendar time-block with inputs for scheduling each hour. User input is stored to local storage. Those elements should be dynamically styled relative to the current time of day. The original project called to use moment.js, but I chose to use another recommended platform, luxon.",
